module Maglev

  # +Model+ implements a very simple, and un-production-worthy, persistence
  # model.
  #
  # It provides the following services:
  # * Manages a class specific collection for instances of that class.
  # * Defines +persistent_new+ to create an instance and put it in the
  #   persistent collection.
  #
  # Some gotchas:
  # * If the module is re-included (or the file that defines the class is
  #   re-run), then all previous saved instances will be lost.

    # includes this module.
